-- Tanner/Klein - Matlab Simulink Project Simulation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: All scripts must be run from the directory where this README file 
      exists.

 1. In Matlab Command Window execute simulation constants script by typing
    "Sim_Constants" and hitting Enter.

 2. Now that constants are declared any of the models can be opened by 
    double clicking the .slx files in the Current Folder list.

 3. To simulate models againts theoretical expectation, open the "bertool"
    analysis tool by typing "bertool" into the Command Window and pressing 
    Enter.

 4. Using the "Theoretical" tab, select the modulation type under review 
    and select the "plot" button when ready to view theoretical plots of 
    BER vs. Eb/No.

 5. Next navigate to the "Monte Carlo" tab to select the Eb/No range to sweep
    the model. Use the browse button next to the Simulation MATLAB file 
    text box to select the .slx file for modelling. Also enter the BER variable
    from the model in the "BER variable name" text box.

 6. Select the "run" button to run simulation and view simulation vs. theoretical
    results.
